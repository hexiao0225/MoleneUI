      <div className="paragraph">
      <p>Algeria has an eventful history, still apparent in its geography, demonstrate by Algiers, with its highly eclectic urbanism. The city’s has some of the world’s richest and most varied architecture. Yan Bighetti of Flogny is eager to explore this maze of history, like taking a trip back in time. 
From the top of its cliff, overlooking the Mediterranean, Algiers is recognizable by its pale facade that earned it the name “north Africa’s white lady.” Born of the sea, Algeria’s capital extends toward the ridge and down the coast. Up on high, the kasbah (citadel), while declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has long been deserted by the upper classes and has fallen into a pitiful state of neglect. Algerian authorities have hired architect Jean Nouvel to restore it, a decision not welcomed by all.</p>
      <p>2.382 million km2 of land to explore: a traveler’s dream.</p>
      <p>Not very open to tourism and relatively unknown, Algeria is shrouded in mystery. It is a three-faced country that operates at three speeds. Turned towards the Mediterranean, the North is urban, modern and dynamic. The deeper we go inland and into the mountains (Kabylia, the land of the Chaoui…), the more the populations are rural and live according to traditional lifestyles… then comes the vast desert, which represents a door to another world.</p>
